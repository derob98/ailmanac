Copy-paste pattern cards that work on any AI.

<LevelBadge level="all" />

A toolbox of reusable prompting patterns. Each card tells you what it is, when to reach for it, and gives you a copy-paste template. They stack — combine them freely. New here? Start with [Prompting Basics](/docs/prompting/basics) first.

<Callout type="objectives" items={["Recognize the 11 core prompting patterns and when each one applies","Grab a copy-paste template for any task — zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and more","Combine patterns (role + example + output constraint + permission to abstain) into one strong prompt","Use grounding to cut hallucinations and meta-prompting to fix weak prompts"]} />

## Zero-shot (just ask, clearly)

**When:** simple, common tasks. **Why:** least effort, often enough.

<PromptCard title="Zero-shot summary">{`Summarize the text below in 5 bullets for a busy manager.
TEXT: """{paste}"""`}</PromptCard>

## Few-shot (show examples)

**When:** you need a specific format or style. **Why:** examples teach faster than descriptions. See [Few-Shot Done Right](/docs/prompting/few-shot).

<PromptCard title="Few-shot sentiment classifier">{`Classify the sentiment as positive/negative/neutral.
Review: "Loved it, shipped fast" → positive
Review: "Broke on day one" → negative
Review: "{new review}" →`}</PromptCard>

## Chain-of-thought (think step by step)

**When:** math, logic, multi-step reasoning. **Why:** reasoning before answering improves accuracy.

<PromptCard title="Chain-of-thought">{`Work through this step by step, then give the final answer on its own line.
PROBLEM: {problem}`}</PromptCard>

## Decomposition (break it down)

**When:** big, fuzzy tasks. **Why:** smaller subtasks are easier and more reliable.

<PromptCard title="Decomposition">{`First, list the sub-tasks needed to {goal}. Then do them one at a time,
showing each result before moving on.`}</PromptCard>

## Role prompting (assign a persona)

**When:** you want a specific lens or standard. **Why:** primes relevant behaviour.

<PromptCard title="Role prompting">{`You are a meticulous senior copy editor. Edit the text for clarity and concision
without changing meaning. Show a bullet list of the changes you made.`}</PromptCard>

## Output-format constraint

**When:** the result feeds another tool, or you want consistency. **Why:** predictable shapes are usable.

<PromptCard title="Output-format constraint">{`Reply with ONLY valid JSON matching: {"title": string, "tags": string[]}.
No prose, no markdown fences.`}</PromptCard>

## Self-consistency / self-critique

**When:** correctness matters. **Why:** a second pass catches first-pass errors.

<PromptCard title="Self-critique">{`Answer the question. Then, in a section called "Check", critique your own answer
for errors or missing cases and revise if needed.`}</PromptCard>

## Grounding (answer only from provided context)

**When:** facts matter — Q&A over your docs, RAG, anything where a wrong answer is worse than no answer. **Why:** the single biggest lever against [hallucinations](/docs/foundations/hallucinations) is forbidding the model to invent and giving it explicit permission to abstain.

<PromptCard title="Grounded Q&A">{`Answer the QUESTION using ONLY the CONTEXT below. Quote the exact sentence(s)
you relied on. If the context does not contain the answer, reply exactly:
"Not found in the provided context." Do not use outside knowledge.

CONTEXT: """{paste your sources}"""
QUESTION: {question}`}</PromptCard>

## Meta-prompting (let AI improve your prompt)

**When:** your prompt underperforms. **Why:** the model is good at spotting what it's missing.

<PromptCard title="Meta-prompting">{`Here's my prompt: "{prompt}". Ask me the 3 questions that would most improve it,
then rewrite it incorporating sensible defaults.`}</PromptCard>

## Iterative refinement

**When:** almost always. **Why:** the first output is a draft, not the destination.

<PromptCard title="Iterative refinement">{`{after a result} Shorter and more concrete. Keep the second paragraph. Add one
example. Drop the marketing tone.`}</PromptCard>

:::tip Combine them
A strong real prompt is often: a **role** + an **example** + an **output constraint** + permission to **say "I don't know."** Layer the cards.

## How to layer the cards

<Steps items={[{title: "Start with a role", body: "Assign the persona or standard you want — e.g. a meticulous senior copy editor — to prime relevant behaviour."},{title: "Add an example", body: "Show one or two few-shot examples so the model learns your format or style faster than a description could teach it."},{title: "Add an output constraint", body: "Pin down the shape: ONLY valid JSON, 5 bullets, no markdown fences — whatever the next step needs."},{title: "Grant permission to abstain", body: "Let the model say I do not know or Not found in the provided context instead of inventing an answer."},{title: "Refine iteratively", body: "Treat the first output as a draft. Ask for shorter, more concrete, keep this paragraph, drop that tone — repeat until it lands."}]} />

<Callout type="takeaways" items={["Patterns are reusable building blocks — pick by task: zero-shot for simple, few-shot for format, chain-of-thought for reasoning, decomposition for big tasks","Grounding (answer only from context + permission to abstain) is the strongest defense against hallucinations","Output-format constraints make results predictable and tool-ready","The cards stack: a strong prompt is usually role + example + output constraint + permission to say 'I don't know'","First output is a draft — refine iteratively, and use meta-prompting when a prompt underperforms"]} />
