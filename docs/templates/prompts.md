# Reusable Prompt Templates

Task-mapped, XML-structured prompts with expected output and failure notes.

<LevelBadge level="all" />

Grab-and-go prompts for common tasks. They use [XML tags](/docs/prompting/xml-tags) for clean structure and bake in the habits from [Prompting Basics](/docs/prompting/basics). Fill the `{braces}`.

## Summarize (grounded)

```text
<instructions>
Summarize the document for {audience} in {N} bullet points. Use ONLY the document;
if something isn't there, say "not stated." Then list any action items.
</instructions>
<document>
{paste}
</document>
```
*Expected:* tight bullets + action items. *Common failure:* invents facts → the "ONLY the document" clause guards against it.

## Extract structured data

```text
Extract the following from the text as JSON: {field1, field2, field3}.
Return ONLY valid JSON, no prose. If a field is missing, use null.
<text>{paste}</text>
```
*Pair with* [structured output](/docs/api/structured-output) for reliability.

## Rewrite / edit

```text
Rewrite the text to be {clearer/shorter/more formal} without changing meaning.
Then list the changes you made as bullets.
<text>{paste}</text>
```

## Code review

```text
Review this diff for correctness bugs, missing edge cases, and security issues.
Report ONLY high-confidence findings as a checklist with file:line. Diff:
<diff>{paste}</diff>
```

## Decision helper

```text
I'm deciding between {A} and {B} for {situation}. Build a trade-off table across
the criteria that matter, then recommend one and name the biggest risk.
```

## Meta-prompt (improve a prompt)

```text
Here's my prompt: "{prompt}". Ask me the 3 questions that would most improve it,
then rewrite it with sensible defaults.
```

## Role + guardrail wrapper

```text
You are {role}. {task}.
Constraints: {format, length, tone}. If you're unsure or lack info, say so rather
than guessing.
```

:::tip[Make them yours]
Save the ones you use as [slash commands](/docs/templates/slash-commands) or a [Project](/docs/claude-app/projects) so you never retype them.
